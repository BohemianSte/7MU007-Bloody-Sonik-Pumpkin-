## Description

The Bloody Sonik Pumpkin is a novel distortion effect proccessor built within the open source software PureData. The effect of the unit is based around the idea of a 'reverse distortion' with the distortion only being triggered as the input signal descends below a designated threshold. The inspiration for the design came from a personal enjoyment of distortion as a concept as well as an interest into using distortion in new ways in order to aid the creative process.

Development within distortion

## Development

In the following image is the initial design sketch as well as the initial concept of the software which at that time was intended to be a physical design. 


Unfortunately I was unable to include any sort of imagery within the current build of the BSP but for the next phase of its development I would like to include some imagery that can further distinguish it as a product.
The following image is an early mockup of the type of imagery that would be included in any further development of the BSP as a product:

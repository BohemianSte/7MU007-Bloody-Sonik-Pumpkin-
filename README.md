# 7MU007-Bloody-Sonik-Pumpkin-


## Description

The Bloody Sonik Pumpkin is a novel distortion effect proccessor built within the open source software PureData. The effect of the unit is based around the idea of a 'reverse distortion' with the distortion only being triggered as the input signal descends below a designated threshold. The inspiration for the design came from a personal enjoyment of distortion as a concept as well as an interest into using distortion in new ways in order to aid the creative process.
